# 2. Psuedocode the High level Approach

# Set up the game initially
#   Create a game board
#   Create a couple players

# Start the game loop
#   Display the board
#   Ask for and validate the current player's move
#   If the game should end
#     Display the proper victory / draw prompt
#     Stop looping
#   Else
#     Switch to the next player and keep looping

# A high level pseudocoding will cover the major actions
